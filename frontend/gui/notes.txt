Install Nodejs:

    sudo apt-get install curl
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -

    sudo apt-get install nodejs

    nmp -v

Install Create-react-app package:

    npm install create-react-app -g

Create frontend application with above package:

    create-react-app gui

*********************************************

while development, especially when a new package is installed using npm 
(ex. npm install antd --save) if error code ELIFECYCLE is recieved, solve it by:

    npm cache clean --force
    rm -rf node_modules && rm ./package-lock.json && npm install
    
    npm start 

Still if issue persist there is some error with code in App.js probably.
Here it was solved by changing it to OOPs approach in App.js,
Later will see how it works with functional programming approach. 
For a beginner learning React OOPs is better.
